Grive 0.1.1
9 June 2012

https://github.com/Grive/grive/wiki

Grive is still considered experimental. It just downloads all the files in your google drive
into the current directory. After you make some changes to the local files, run grive and
it will upload your changes back to your google drive. New files created in local or google
drive will be uploaded or downloaded respectively. Deleted files will also be "removed".
Currently Grive will NOT destroy any of your files: it will only move the files to a
directory named .trash, or put it in the google drive trash. You can always recover them.

There are a few things that grive does not do at the moment:
- wait for changes in file system to occur and upload. Grive only sync when you run it.
- symbolic links support
- support for Google documents
  
Of course these will be done in future, possibly the next release.

You need the following libraries:

- json-c
- libcurl
- libstdc++
- libgcrypt
- Boost (Boost filesystem is required)

There are also some optional dependencies:
- CppUnit (for unit tests)
- libbfd (for backtrace)
- binutils (for libiberty, required for compilation in OpenSUSE & ubuntu)

Grive uses cmake to build, see the instructions in:

https://github.com/Grive/grive/wiki/Installation

for detailed procedures to compile Grive.

When grive is ran for the first time, you should use the "-a" argument to grant
permission to grive to access to your Google Drive. An URL should be printed.
Go to the link. You will need to login to your google account if you haven't
done so. After granting the permission to grive, the browser will show you
an authenication code. Copy-and-paste that to the standard input of grive.

If everything works fine, grive will create a .grive and a .grive_state file in your
current directory. It will also start downloading files from your Google Drive to
your current directory.

Enjoy!
