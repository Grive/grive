Description: Grive2: an open source Linux client for Google Drive
 .
 This is the up-to-date fork of the original "Grive" (https://github.com/Grive/grive) 
 Google Drive client with the support for the new Drive REST API and partial 
 sync.
 .
 For the first time running grive, you should use the "-a" argument to grant
 permission to grive to access to your Google Drive. An URL should be printed.
 Go to the page. You will need to login to your google account if you haven't
 done so. After granting the permission to grive, the browser will show you
 an authenication code. Copy-and-paste that to the standard input of grive.
 If everything works fine, grive will create .grive and .grive_state inside the
 synchronized directory. It will also start downloading files from your Google
 Drive to that directory.
